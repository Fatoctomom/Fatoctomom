### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## âœ¨About Me
I am Minh Khoi Nguyen, an undergraduate student at the University of California Santa Cruz currently working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

I have experience working with **C, C++, Python, and Java**. I'm currently specialized in **machine learning**, but I'm not currently hard set on it yet. Most of my machine learning work has been done in Python using tools such as **Pytorch and Pandas**.

Outside of work, I like to keep a balance of indoor and outdoor hobbies. The things I like to do indoors mainly consist of playing a variety of video games, watching movies/shows, building PCs, and cooking. As for outdoor activities I love to ski, hike, and play badminton. New interests I'm looking to pickup include running or swimming, and finishing up my scuba license 

In addition, I love to travel abroad, my last experience was studying abroad in Sendai, Miyagi Japan
